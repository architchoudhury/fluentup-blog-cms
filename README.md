# [FluentUp Blog](https://blog.fluentup.com)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a6fad42f-298a-47a1-81d1-0ffb06d904b9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsby-blog-fluentup/deploys)

**Note:** This starter uses [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/).

This repo contains the code for FluentUp's blog which uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): **[Link](https://blog.fluentup.com/)**.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.


## Prerequisites

- Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

### Access Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ npm run start
```
To test the CMS locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:
```
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```


## Getting Started (Without Netlify)
```
$ gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME] https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/
$ cd [SITE_DIRECTORY_NAME]
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```

### Setting up the CMS
Follow the [Netlify CMS Quick Start Guide](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/quick-start/#authentication) to set up authentication, and hosting.

## Debugging
Windows users might encounter ```node-gyp``` errors when trying to npm install.
To resolve, make sure that you have both Python 2.7 and the Visual C++ build environment installed.
```
npm config set python python2.7
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

## Purgecss
This plugin uses [gatsby-plugin-purgecss](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-purgecss/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io/). The bulma builds are usually ~170K but reduced 90% by purgecss.
