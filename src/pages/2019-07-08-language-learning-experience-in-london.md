<br>To explore the world, Halu joined a 1-month trip to London to learn English. After that, he flew to Iceland for the northern lights. Let’s hear what he says about the trip!

**Why did you decide to study English in London?**

I worked as an officer for a train company in Hong Kong. Every day I met lots of travellers from all over the world. I love communicating with people, especially people from different countries and cultures. At the same time, I wanted to see the world. Therefore, I went to London for a short English course.

**<br>How was your trip?**

It was really great! London is a vibrant city, I met lots of awesome people there. After a month in London, my English had improved substantially. In Hong Kong, the education system mainly focuses on reading and writing; but in London, I got the chance to speak English in real life situations. It improved my confidence and communication skills.



**You also love photography, can you share more?**

Yes! After the trip, I flew to Iceland to catch the northern lights. I love photography, and I wanted to see the world as much as possible while I am still young and healthy. It was so cold in Iceland and I went there alone. But it was a memorable experience! I met lots of people during the journey, and managed to speak a few words in Icelandic! I love taking pictures of people as well, it was so nice to meet some new friends and learn their stories. I love to use a camera to capture every moment of my life!

<br>**What is your next plan and travel destination?** 

I just came back from Canada and currently I am in Japan. I want to go to New Zealand in 2018 and at the same time, I want to continue learning English and pick up one new language. I want to travel to more places and capture the best moments of the world with my camera. I firmly believe in the principle that life is about creating yourself!
