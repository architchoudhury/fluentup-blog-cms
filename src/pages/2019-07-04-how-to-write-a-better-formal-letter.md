<br>It’s important to ensure that you are using the proper tone and correct language. In this article, we will provide you with some tips to write a better formal letter and some useful phrases to include in the letter.

1. **Be precise and concise:**<p>Be direct and to the point. Explicitly let the reader know your purpose of writing in the first paragraph. Avoid using fancy language. Don’t ramble or include any unnecessary information. A formal letter requires a swift delivery of intent, so save your fancy vocabulary for creative writing.</p><br>
2. **Use the right tone:**<p>Make sure you use the right tone when writing a formal letter. A formal letter should be polite and sincere (yes, even when you are writing a letter of complaint). You can do so by using polite words, for instance “could”, “would”, “may”, “please”… Avoid contractions (such as “can’t”, “I’m, “that’s”, etc.), slangs and jargons.</p><br>
3. **Use of acronyms and abbreviations:**<p>It is common in the business world to use acronyms to abbreviate terms. However, when writing in a formal manner, ensure that the full name of the term is mentioned at least for the first time you use it. For instance, when writing about Private Equity, which can be abbreviated into PE, you should write “Private Equity (PE)” the first time you mention it. Subsequent mentions can then be written as “PE”. Remember that although formal writing should be concise, it should still be understandable by the reader.</p><br>
4. **Proofread:**<p>Mistakes create a bad impression. Check your accuracy in your grammar and spelling carefully. Read it over multiple times and more preferably ask someone to check it for you. If you are handwriting your letter, make sure your writing is neat and clear.</p><br>

**Below are some practical phrases to suit different purposes in the letter.**
