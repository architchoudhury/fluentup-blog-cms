<br>_**The Bing Sutt**_



_Bing sutt_, the Cantonese reading of the characters “冰室” — meaning “ice” and “room” — were the original incarnations of _cha chaan teng’s_. They were first spotted around the 1940s, when the city was still under the rule of the British colonial empire. Influenced by the British customs of afternoon tea, bing sutt’s served a wide variety of drinks and light snacks such as baked goods and desserts, very much like the café franchises Starbucks or Pacific Coffee that we see nowadays. Central to their service was the way they served their food quickly and at cheap, affordable prices. The name “ice room” might have come about because of the cold drinks, shaved ice desserts, ice cream they tend to serve.



**The _Cha Chaan Teng_**



_Cha chaan teng_, with the characters “茶餐廳”, has the literal meaning of “tea restaurant”. A common perception is that they evolved from _bing sutt_ to meet the growing demands of customers, offering everything the _bing sutt_ had to offer in addition to full-cooked meals, from rice dishes to spaghettis to soup-instant noodles.



However, the true difference actually lies in the type of restaurant license owned by the two. _Bing sutt’s_ carry a “smaller” license that only allows them to carry cooked food items — dishes that don’t require a stove. The licenses carried by _cha chaan teng’s_ allowed them to cook in their kitchens, which is the reason why _cha chaan teng’s_ menus are so much more varied.



These days, locals generally refer to this sort of restaurant as _cha chaan teng_. While a small number of stores might still have the characters for _bing sutt_ in their name, they are _cha chaan teng_ through and through.



Whether you go to _cha chaan teng’s_ regularly or have never set foot in one, here are a few dishes and drinks that you will almost certainly find and definitely should try in all _cha chaan teng’s_ in Hong Kong:<br><br>
