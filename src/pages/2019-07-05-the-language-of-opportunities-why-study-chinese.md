<br>Even the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, one of the wealthiest guys in the world running an influential company every day is trying hard to study his Chinese, here are some reasons I believe you should consider learning the language as well.

1. **Chinese will open up a world of opportunities for you** <p><br>**China’s economy is booming**
   <p>China’s economy has grown massively in the recent decade, and the country is now an important player on the global business stage. In fact — it’s the world’s biggest ecommerce market, making it an important country to do business with if you plan to be an international business tycoon! Studying Chinese does offer many benefits to professional growth.
   
   **Businessmen in China are seeking to invest in overseas businesses**
   <p>As more business began to emerge from China, they also seek to establish a global footprint. Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei are aggressively expanding their business worldwide. Due to the lack of people in the Western business world who can speak both Chinese and English, you can benefit yourself by studying Chinese and transform yourself into somebody who is important to the success of a project that is related to China, thereby making yourself a very attractive hire.
   
   **Manage cultural diversity in the workplace**
   <p>Learning to communicate in a foreign language often forces us to learn how to listen. And the ability to listen and understand others is important for one to succeed in the workplace. Studying Chinese for business can establish a cultural IQ, which will make you look more trustworthy and accomplished to others.

2.  **Enjoy wider and deeper travelling** <p>Chinese is not only spoken in China — it’s also spoken in Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and many other places besides. A lot of countries also have strong Chinese populations, and being able to speak Chinese will make your travelling experience more enjoyable. Especially China has a huge non-Enlgish-speaking population, to get a real local experience while travelling, the ability to speak Chinese is always beneficial!</p><br>
3. **Chinese isn’t as hard as you think** <p>When it comes to the issue of grammatical complexity, Chinese is really one of the easiest languages to learn. Unlike many European languages, it does not contain complicated grammar components like cases, genders and plurals. It also treats tenses in a very simple way. Also, you will have lots of chances to practice due to the large Chinese-speaking populations. Just find a native chinese speaker online to study the language!</p><br>
4.  **A semester abroad in China** <p>China is not only one of the oldest and richest cultures in the world — it’s also an exciting, fast-growing modern country. While the economy is exploding, the living cost in China is surprisingly low. There are also many language schools in China that help you study the language.
