A 2013 report by British Council, titled “[Languages for the Future](https://cdn.studyinternational.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/www.britishcouncil.org_sites_britishcouncil.uk2_files_languages-for-the-future-report.pdf)” identified Spanish as the most important language UK nationals should learn. There are about 400 million native Spanish speakers in the world, making it the second most widely spoken language, holding an official language status in 21 different countries. The overall Spanish speaking population continues to grow in quantity as well as economically, socially and culturally.

## **Reasons to Learn Spanish:**

1. Similarities to English: <p>English shares a heritage with Spanish. This makes it easier for a person who already speaks English to relate and learn most of the words of the Spanish language. While Johann Wolfgang von Goethe may have been exaggerating when he said</p><blockquote><p>“He who knows no foreign language, knows nothing of his own.”</p></blockquote><p>It cannot be denied that if you have studied English, you will, without doubt, gain a better understanding of Spanish.</p><p><ul><li>Actor (English) — Actor (Spanish)</li><li>Admirable(English) — Admirable (Spanish)</li><li>Area (English) — Area (Spanish)</li><li>Auto (English) — Auto (Spanish)</li><li>Cafe (English) — Café (Spanish)</li></ul></p>

2. Boosts employment prospects:<p>Language skills are a huge plus in today’s competitive market. As Spanish is widely spoken, it is becoming a valuable asset for employees and employers.
