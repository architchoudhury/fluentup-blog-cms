Andy from Italy: “Through FluentUp, I found one of the best Mandarin schools in Hong Kong. I was looking for a high quality course at an affordable price, and FluentUp suited my need for flexibility. I am now taking an HSK Level 5 Preparation Course online and will continue my course when I get back to Milan!”

<br>Erika from Hong Kong: “I was looking for German course after passing my German A2 exam. FluentUp provides me a certain level of flexibility and offers me a good quality course at an affordable price. It is quite difficult to find a native German teacher in Hong Kong and FluentUp helps me connect to a language school in Berlin. It is awesome! ”

<br>Halu from Hong Kong: “I wanted to improve my English but I didn’t want to go to a traditional English language school. The class size there is big and it is not customized. Luckily I found FluentUp, I found a native English teacher from a recognised Online Language School in London and am having individual English classes online. It is flexible and the teacher helps me a lot on speaking/conversational skills, which is exactly what I needed. ”
