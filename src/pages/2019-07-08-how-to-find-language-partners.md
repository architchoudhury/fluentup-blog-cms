  If you want to practice a language, one of the best and most cost-effective
  ways is to find a language exchange partner. A language exchange partner is
  someone who is a native speaker of the language you’re studying and is also
  interested in learning your native language. For example, if you are an
  English native speaker and want to study Spanish, you can find a Spanish
  native speaker who would like to learn English. You two can exchange each
  other’s languages and help each other without any cost.
