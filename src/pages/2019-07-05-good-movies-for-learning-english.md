<br>Learning a language is much easier when you’re enjoying yourself. Can’t think of any good movie? No worries, we have your back and have prepared a list of recommendations for you to improve your English.

However first, take some time to understand why watching movies is important for learning English. Watching movies in English is an awesome way of improving your English — especially your English speaking and listening skills. Particularly[ from a linguistics point of view](https://blog.fluentup.com/2019-07-05-the-best-way-to-learn-a-language-what-the-linguists-say/), learning a new language needs to start with listening. Here are 3 reasons why watching movie is useful for learning English.

1. **Introduce you to expressions of everyday use** <p>Textbook and classroom English is not enough! After learning the basic stuff from your teacher, it’s important to complement your studies by getting real-life conversation. The English used in movies is natural. It’s also very close to what you’ll hear if you speak with native English speakers too. You will learn the daily terms that will not be covered in your textbooks. This will help improve your listening and speaking skills.</p><br>
2.  **Educate your ear, familiarise yourself with intonation and different accents**<p>Feeling frustrated when you learn English for a long time, but then suddenly you can’t understand a single word that someone is saying? I know it can be hugely disappointing. It is common for students become accustomed to their English teacher’s voice, accent and speech patterns. Then when they communicate with others, they have problems understanding what is being said. Therefore, watching movies is a good way to educate your ear, and let yourself familiarize with different phrases and accents.</p><br>
3. **Speak like a native** <p>Watching English movies will expose you to real English pronunciation and speaking styles. You can also listen for stress and rhythm in native English speaking. Sometimes you can try to repeat the dialogues in the movies. One of the methods I used before was printing out the movie script and replaying the scene several times. After that, I would read out the script loud until I could speak the dialogues fluently and naturally. The process was tedious, but really useful!</p>

So now, it’s time to introduce 5 good movies for learning English.

1.  **Hunger Games**<p>Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) voluntarily takes her younger sister’s place in the Hunger Games: a televised competition in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to fight to the death. The Hunger Games is an adaptation of the 3 fantasy books aimed at younger readers by Suzanne Collins. The movie is intense, entertaining and thought-provoking. If you haven’t watched them, take the chance to enjoy this wonderful story while improving your English!<br><br>
