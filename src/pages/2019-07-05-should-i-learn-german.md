<br>Besides the obvious advantages that learning any language brings, here are our top 6 reasons why you should learn German! ​

**Why should you learn German? Because German is similar to English**

German is definitely not an easy language to learn, but good news is, it would be easier if you already speak English. This is because German and English share the same Germanic root. Consequently, there are many thousands of words which are closely related known as “cognates.” In fact, 26% of English vocabulary has shared roots with German.



Can you guess what the following German words mean? 

**Haus, Buch, Bett, Mutter, Schwimmen, Blau, Alt, Sonnig** 

(Answer is at the end of the article)



German grammar might be a bit complicated, but it’s very systematic (we all know Germans are very systematic in their thinking!) Therefore, the German grammar rules might be difficult to comprehend when you first learn them, but they are very structured and logical, hence it’s not so difficult to master the rules after you learn the language for a longer time.
