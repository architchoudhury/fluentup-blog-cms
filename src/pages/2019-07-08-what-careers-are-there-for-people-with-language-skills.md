**Language-related career:**

<br>

1. **Translator/Interpreter** <p>Translating and interpreting are essentially about language conversion. The difference is that translating focuses on written text, covering a range of topics such as business, science, legal and technical. Interpreting uses speech in a range of settings: one-to-one communications, meetings, events and conferences. Both jobs require high level of proficiency in target languages. Cultural awareness and knowledge of the specialized areas (law, marketing, current affairs, etc) are crucial.</p><br>
2. **Language Teacher**  <p>Teaching is a good way to share your love of languages, with options to teach in schools, further and higher education, teaching English as a foreign language abroad, and also in a freelance capacity. If you enjoy teaching and languages, being a language teacher could be a good career option. You can even consider an entrepreneurial career and seek out freelance language-based opportunities. Private tutoring, translating, or other services can be lucrative if marketed well to the right niche.</p><br>**Fields where speaking another language is a big advantage<br>**<br>

3. **Tourism/Hospitality** <p>The hospitality, travel and tourism industry is a global business, covering areas such as adventure tourism, food services management, hospitality services and hotels. Language skills can be particularly useful for hotel staff, airline crew and tour operators.</p><br>
4.  **Journalism** <p>You will meet a lot of people as a journalist. Good communication skill is a must. Besides that, if you can speak more than one language, it certainly bring you some advantages when covering and reporting international news and affairs.</p><br>
5.  **Public Relations, Event and Marketing** <p>International conferences, events management and exhibitions are a good way to use language skills. Market research, marketing communications (digital marketing and social media), brand management, direct marketing, advertising and public relations (PR) are areas where foreign languages could be useful, especially if dealing with international audiences and clients.
